## Main Concerns  
- **Trustworthiness**: The administrators of these instances could have modified variants of vaultwarden that would collect the master password.  
- **Security Risks**: Public servers may not be well-maintained, leading to potential vulnerabilities.  
- **Uptime & Data Loss**: No guarantees are made that these services will remain online or keep your data safe.  

## The Upsides 
Compared to proprietary password managers like **1Password, LastPass, and Dashlane**, Vaultwarden is:  
- **Open-source** – No hidden tracking or data collection  
- **Self-hostable** – Full control over your data  
- **More Private** – No centralized provider that can be hacked  

Even when using a **public Vaultwarden instance**, it's still preferable to using a **closed-source, proprietary** solution.  

## VS Official Bitwarden Server
Vaultwarden offers **many premium Bitwarden features for free**, such as:  

- **Unlimited device sync** (official Bitwarden limits this for free accounts)  
- **Built-in TOTP (2FA) code storage** (Bitwarden requires a paid plan)  
- **File attachments** (official Bitwarden requires a paid plan)  
- **Custom server settings & performance tweaks** (admin server settings for hoster)  

## Recommendation
For security and control, **self-hosting** Vaultwarden is strongly recommended. See [Vaultwarden GitHub](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) for setup instructions.
