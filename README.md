## Main Concerns  
- **Trustworthiness**: The administrators of these instances have access to your **encrypted** vault but may still collect metadata.  
- **Security Risks**: Public servers may not be well-maintained, leading to potential vulnerabilities.  
- **Uptime & Data Loss**: No guarantees are made that these services will remain online or keep your data safe.  

For security and control, **self-hosting** Vaultwarden is strongly recommended. See [Vaultwarden GitHub](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) for setup instructions.
